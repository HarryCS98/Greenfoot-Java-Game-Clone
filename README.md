## Introduction to the project
In this Project the idea was to create a driving game within java using only the Java swing GUI library. The user had to be able to drive around a track avoid the walls and obstacles while trying to reach the end point denoted by a white square. If the user touched a wall or obstacle the game would end the the user would have to restart the level to continue. The game also showed the user which square he was driving over the direction of the car using a compass and a letter readout along with which track he was driving on. The game consists of three levels the first and second levels being predetermined while the third being a randomly generated one. Then finally the game allowed the user to use the run button and have the game automatically play its self the car would drive around the track to the finish using a depth first search pathfinding algorithm.
